/**
 * A FileIO that works normally (delegating to HadoopFileIO) but whose class is not on Comet's
 * recognized-FileIO allowlist. Composition rather than inheritance is the point: a HadoopFileIO
 * SUBCLASS passes the hierarchy check by design, while this class must be declined. Instantiated
 * reflectively by Iceberg's {@code CatalogUtil.loadFileIO}, hence top-level with a no-arg
 * constructor.
 *
 * <p>Written in Java, not Scala, because {@code getConf()} is concrete on some supported Iceberg
 * versions and abstract on others. Scala would need {@code override} in the first case and reject
 * it in the second; Java accepts one declaration for both.
